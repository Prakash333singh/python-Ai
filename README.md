# 🤖 Agentic Systems & Large Language Models (LLMs)

Welcome to this repository exploring the intersection of **Agentic AI architectures** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. This project aims to demonstrate how autonomous agents powered by LLMs can reason, plan, and act in complex environments with minimal human intervention.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repo showcases:
- Agentic workflows using LLMs as reasoning engines
- Modular agent design with memory, tools, and goal-driven behavior
- Experiments in task decomposition, multi-agent collaboration, and tool use
- Integration with external APIs, environments, and knowledge bases

---

## 🧠 What Are Agentic Systems?

Agentic systems are AI entities that:
- Operate autonomously toward defined goals
- Make decisions based on context, memory, and feedback
- Use tools and APIs to interact with the world
- Adapt strategies based on outcomes and changing environments

These systems go beyond simple prompt-response models by incorporating planning, reflection, and long-term memory.

## 📚 What Are LLMs?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are deep learning models trained on massive text corpora. They:
- Understand and generate human-like text
- Perform reasoning, summarization, translation, and more
- Serve as the cognitive core of agentic systems

Popular examples include GPT, Claude, and Mistral.
